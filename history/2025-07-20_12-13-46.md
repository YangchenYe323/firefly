## Prompt

I have made some db schema change to make the site multi-tenant. I want you to refactor the admin page to reflect the change:

- I have separated Song from VtuberSong, where Song is the definition of song shared by all vtubers, and VtuberSong is a Song in a vtuber's song list.
- Please refactor the admin page so that:
- “编辑歌曲” tab now updates the Song table, managing the shared song database, look at the prisma schema to see what fields are vtuber specific and mvoed to VtuberSongs, and remove it from the edit song tab
- Add a new tab "编辑主播歌单" that edits the VtuberSong table. The update should only update the vtuber specific field (remark, etc), and the occurrence edit panel should also be moved under this edit tab. This tab, when creating, should have a dropdown/search to allow user to select which Song to add, and prompt the user to create a Song if not exist

I have implemented the necessary backend APIs in action/v2/profile.ts. Use those APIs

### Follow-up 1
Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.

When I edit or create a VtuberSong.

### Follow-up 2
Ok a couple issues:
- numLike and numDislike should not be editable and displayed in VtuberSongs table
- Also add a select menu for scStatus, name it "SC点歌", and populate a select list by listing all the available SuperChat names, add a server action to retrieve that in the backend.
- In create vtuber songs, add a way to jump to creating a new song if the song user wants to add is not already in the list

### Follow-up 3
Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.

When I edit vtuber song

### Follow-up 4
In the edit vtuber song panel, the occurrence expanded menu cannot be unexpanded

### Follow-up 5
In the song selection, can you also support search?

### Follow-up 6
Please hide the selection song when editing a vtuber song. We don't support changing the linked song in that menu
