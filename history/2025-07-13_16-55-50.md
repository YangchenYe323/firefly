## Prompt
Could you refactor the ThemeProvider to use raw CSS animation instead of framer motion? Trying to see if can get it less laggy. It's fine to just use easeOut since spring is not available for native CSS. Use the recommended ease out animation described in the rule

### Follow-up 1
Now the old pic disappeared immediately and new image are sliding in onto a white background. Could you retain the old behavior where the old image and new image are both present in the scene, and the old one gradually slides out like IOS album sliding behavior?

### Follow-up 2
The bottom to prompt for changing theme show up once and disappeared and is flapping when I hover over the avatar

### Follow-up 3
Could you not use the standard ease-out from tailwind? Try eas-in-out-quad described in animation.mdc 

### Follow-up 4
Could you make the link in the header smaller and align them to the center? Make sure they can still fit on one line on a mobile phone. Also, please add some padding to the top so they don't overlap with the arrow
