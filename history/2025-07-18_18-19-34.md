## Prompt

I'd like you to redesign and implement the header part of the main UI. The issue is that when we go to a mobile first design and make the main song table narrower, the header becomes too wide and looks out of harmony. I'd like you to redesign the structure:

- Remove the UserNav and song player button. They are not used.
- Remove the always-on header, instead, make it disappear and can drop down when user clickes a semi-transparent arrow on top of the screen. On mobile let the user drag the header down.
- Design the drop-down area to show all the external links in a tasteful and fun manner

### Follow-up 1
Error: Invalid easing type 'cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)'

When I click the drop down

### Follow-up 2
Ok, I like the animation of the link tabs, but:
- I want the header to mingle with the background, so make it more transparent in background
- I want the header to puish the rest of the screen down when it emerges
- The drop down button is a bit ugly, could you get rid of the circular background, just have an arrow or double arrow which is semi transparent but still visible. 

### Follow-up 3
Could you try add some gradient to the background of the drop down so it kind of flows in a continuous fashion with the rest of the page? Also, when I'm scrolling midway in the page, clicking the button should either bring me to the top or not show me the button at all

### Follow-up 4
It still does not look as good as ideal. One big problem is that the contrast of the color is still very intrusive, How about make the lower part of the heder, which touches the other part of the screen, almost completely transparent, and then gradually having a concrete color going upward?

### Follow-up 5
Ok, now let's tackle the next task. I'd like to move the bilibili profile and live room link away from external links and make them natively supported as part of the profile, this way we can query bilibility and render more vivid cards with actual information. Let's make some effort in preparation for this. Firstly, I have modified the db schema and performed a migration. Look at the db schema and update the profile admin page to allow editing the ne fields.
