## Prompt
I'd like you to refactor the admin page of the project. Currently the admin page is implemented naively using tanstack table. I want you to:

- Reorganize the page so it is divided into a compact table view were I could browse and search through songs using the same filtering mechanisms, and can click a button to expand the selected song into an edit panel where the fields are nicely structured, so I don't have to horizontally scrol to edit a song
- Implement support for deleting a song
- Style the admin page using the state-of-the-art styling framework and UI library. I don't care much about personalization or feel here. But be sure to be extensible so I could add more fields and functionalities later. 

Please proceed by:
- Thoroughly read the doc/ and the relevant source code to understand the functionality of the admin page
- Document and explain the UI/UX using diagrams and graphs before you implement anything
- Be sure to refactor the component structure to better achieve the design goals

Great! In the right shape. However, the add song and edit song button don't work when I edit on mobile. Can you make it that those panels just pop up and take up the screen on mobile? Also, on mobile I don't want the table to horizontally scroll. Can just ignore all columns except ID, name and the action buttons
