## Prompt

Now I'd like you to make changes to the song panel.

#### Goal
The goal is to make the song panel more modern and better on devices with narrow screens like a phone.
- Please adjust the width of the panel so that it is calibrated to mobile view, on a web view just leave more margins around it and responsively shrink the margins when screen size shrinks. The key change is that the panel itself **does not** shrink and is calibrated to mobile view from the very start.
- Change the Panel to be more compact, resembling a spotify playlist. It should roughly look like"
[album avatar] [song name] (remark)                            [reactions] [an Icon to expand details]
                        [musician name]                                    [update time]
- Clicking on a row should remain the behavior of copying the song to clipboard, and we will cram additional functionalities into a detailed view of the song expanded via the icon, but in this batch of change no need to implement the detailed view.
- For now just send dummy placeholders for the avatar, we will save it in the database later, but not in this batch of change. For this batch focus on making the style and composition right.
- The tags should just be one scrollable row on top of the songs, like spotify playlist
- Please add style and shadow to the song panel to make it stand out in comparison to the background and give the whole page a more modern feel.
- Get rid of the shuffling, and make the icon to pick a random song just an Icon above the tag selection row. Also move the search bar there.

#### Design
- You might want to ditch react table in favor of a hand-rolled list, we don't want a horizontally scrollable table at all, but feel free to choose technology using your best judgment

### Follow-up 1
In the right direction, but the style is not quite as I desired. Please make the following changes and use the image I sent you as reference:
- Make the panel a little bit wider, try to at least align with the "和她不一定拿手的542首歌" heading.
- Don't scrol inside the panel, just make the panel extend along with the page itself.
- The panel should not support horizontal scroll at all
- Style the title, remark and misician name text with better font and stylling to make it more beautiful.
- Style the panel background to make it mingle better with the background

### Follow-up 2
A tiny improvement. The overall structure looks great on web but on my iphone 15 pro max there is no margin around the panel, I still want a slim margin. Please fix

### Follow-up 3
On my iphone when I click the song row, focus is moved onto the row but the song is not copied to clipboard, only copied after the second click. Could you fix it so that the first click copies the song?

### Follow-up 4
Now it copies twice and also I get a clickboard dialog popup. Please fix

### Follow-up 5
It still doesn't work quite right. Firstly, when I'm scrolling I don't want to accidentally copy the song but it now copies them along the way. Secondly, I still see a copy-tio-clipboard warning each time. Is it because I'm visiting the site hosted on my PC via LAN IP? if not please also fix

### Follow-up 6
Please add comments detailing the reasoning and design decisions for all the code that are modified

### Follow-up 7
Now please also add comments to SongePanel and ScrollableTags you edited

### Follow-up 8
Ok, after the change of the song panel and row styling, we lost the reactions. Could you add the reaction ability back to SongRow? It should take the space above timestamp on the right side of the row.

### Follow-up 9
This is not right:
- The layout should be:
[title]                                  [reaction]     [expand]
[musician]                          [timestamp]
Now you are having
[reaction]
[timestamp]
[expand]
- Make reaction and expand buttons always on, don't hide them. Use the heart emoji and sweat emoji for like and dislike, and display the current number of like/dislikes

### Follow-up 10
Please make timestamp and expand on the same horizontal alignment, and align reactions to the start of timestamp. 

### Follow-up 11
When songs have different number of numLikes and numDislikes, the width of the number changes (0 vs 100), and the icons are not aligned well. Please fix this and make sure the items are aligned
