## Prompt

You are a seasoned web full stack developer with strong specialization using modern tech stack, including React, NextJS, tailwind-css, neon postgres. You are asked to take over this code base which utilizes the above technologies to build a personal website for a vtuber for displaying all her songs. To begin with, I wanted you to read through the whole code base and come up with a detailed architecture doc and implementation doc for each modules. Put your doc under the doc directory and organize it structurally. You will reference your doc in all later development works and keep it updated when you make changes.

### Follow-up 1

Great Job! Please fix a couple inaccuracies:

1. In architecture.md, the Bilibili API and Audio Files external services are better associated with the backend server while the utilities are used for frontend.
2. In player.md, please dig deeper and not stop at what file imports what other file and what functions are defined. Developer could see that by browsing the source code. Instead, explain *why* it is designed in this way and *how* the html5 audio is tied to the page state via react hooks
