## Prompt

I am implementing a calendar component for vtuber's live schedule. I have implemented a basic structure:

- The whole calendar is a grid where each week is a row, week went backward in time but forward intra-week
- Each day is a cell, and when the user clicks a cell, it expands to a more detailed intra-day timeline showcasing the vtuber's live in detail.

I want you to:

- Properly style the components to make them look beautiful and subtle. Currently I just filled in the content but the styling and structure is not nice
- Use framer-motion's layout animation to make the effect that when user clicks a cell, it gradually expands and becomes the active cell with nice animation

### Follow-up 1
Please reapply your changes. Don't touch the whole calendar yet, just focus on making the active day cell styled and beautiful and animated

### Follow-up 2
Please align the time and the Bilibili_live icon in the Active day cell, now the time is aligned to the middle of the connector

### Follow-up 3
Ok, now we have an issue. Because the active day cell is positioned relative to the whole week's div (which is the relative div above it's absolut positioner), it always expand from the week row. On mobile where one day has it's own row, it becomes a problem. Could you fix it? I still want the active day cell to occupy the full width of the calendar, but in mobile I'd like it to start from the day's own row. 

### Follow-up 4
After your fix, on web the active day cell only takes up the width of a single day, instead of the whole row. Could you try that, for each day cell, have an invisible div that is as wide as the whole week row and then use it to position the active day cell?

### Follow-up 5
Good reasoning. But I think your change could be even simplified? Just add a relative class on the DayCell's enclosing div when on mobile

### Follow-up 6
I think md:relative would cause relative to be added on pc screen instead of mobile, so it's reverse of what I want

### Follow-up 7
Make the active day cell a little bit wider than the enclosing relative div 

### Follow-up 8
Now augment the ActiveDayCell component, and when user clicked the live recording, expand a RecordingTimeline Component to show all songs in the live

### Follow-up 9
When I click inside the ActiveDayCell, it just disappeared

### Follow-up 10
Neither works. And I looked at the console log, it seems that the event fires twice. The first time the event fires on a node that the current target contains, and the click is ignored, but it also fires a second time, where it fires on the white calendar board div

### Follow-up 11
Unfortunately this does not work, the onClick function of the recording div does not even fire

### Follow-up 12
I see that sometimes the song occurrence and the recording are not backgrounded with the same color, and there seems to be an off-by-1 error somewhere between the date of the cell and the date of the recording

### Follow-up 13
The connector and the icon of the song occurrence are not aligned

### Follow-up 14
Now please refactor the way to fill in the style of the calendar a bit and be ready to support multiple themes. Each theme would define css variables. We can start with:
- Background color of the calendar for each week day cell
- Background color of the active calendar for each week day cell
- Background color of the recording entry in the active week day cell
- Background color of the song occurrence entry in the expanded timeline
- Border color of the active calendar for each week day cell
- Text color of the week day cell
- Text color of the active calendar for each week day cell

And then use the css variables corresponding to the specified theme (give a default to start with) and weekday

### Follow-up 15
Why did you duplicated the definition of base, components, etc from global.css in _variable.css? Also,please preserve the toastify css variables that are already there
