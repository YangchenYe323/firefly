## Prompt

I am implementing a calendar component for vtuber's live schedule. I have implemented a basic structure:

- The whole calendar is a grid where each week is a row, week went backward in time but forward intra-week
- Each day is a cell, and when the user clicks a cell, it expands to a more detailed intra-day timeline showcasing the vtuber's live in detail.

I want you to:

- Properly style the components to make them look beautiful and subtle. Currently I just filled in the content but the styling and structure is not nice
- Use framer-motion's layout animation to make the effect that when user clicks a cell, it gradually expands and becomes the active cell with nice animation
