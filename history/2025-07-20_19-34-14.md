## Prompt

Now I would like to expose another recording calendar view in the main page where:
- The recordings are displayed in a rolling calendar grid. The grid is layed out as follows:
1. One week is one row. This component should be reasonably wider on PC screens so the clander is nicely positioned
2. When the screen gets narrower, it collapses to one day on one row.
3. Each day is a cell with date displayed, if that day has lives, all the lives in that day are rendered as stacked cards inside the cell.
4. I have implemented an API in action/v2/archive to query live recordings, use that and react infinite query to implement data fetching. See example of SongOccurrencePanel to see the pattern. Note that the date here should be the live date (the date column) instead of the recording publish date (pubdate column)

- Implement the below hierarchy of UI:
1. When user clicked a calendar cell with recordings, pop up a dialogue showing all the lives of that day.
2. When user clicked a recording from that dialogue. pop up another layer of dialogue to show the timeline of that live as a vertical line, and show song occurrences in there corresponding timestamp. Use the API I defined in actions/v2/song.ts to implement the data fetching.

- Implement a tab beteen heading area and the main panel area to control the switch between song list view and calendar view. The tab should not have borders or background, make it floating on top of the screen and be compact

Please focus on:
- Make sure the components are beautifully styled and make sure a consistent and subtle look

### Follow-up 1
When I go to the calandar view, there is no data, I see an empty calendar, and when I scroll, I see it says loading for a long time and finally I get a PrismaClient is unable to run in this browser environment, or has been bundled for the browser (running in ``). If this is unexpected, please open an issue: https://pris.ly/prisma-prisma-bug-report error

### Follow-up 2
Ok the functionality is there! A couple issues:
- Please show the date (xxx年xx月xx日) on the left top corner of the cell
- It doesn't seem to respond to my scrolling to the end of the screen. It should continue and fetch more archives and extend the calendar back in time

### Follow-up 3
Now when I scroll, it is sending a hundred network request to the backend but show no more live records after getting responses

### Follow-up 4
Ok, please make the calandar go backward in time from top to down

### Follow-up 5
The link to the recording and song occurrences from the calendar does not work. Could you check how the link is constructed and executed in SongOccurrenceCard and fix it?

### Follow-up 6
The window.open approach won't work for bilibili. Please just use a link with href. Make it such that clicking the card will bring user to the link

### Follow-up 7
Also fix the link for clicking the archive please

### Follow-up 8
The calendar order still seems wrong, now I got july as the first month but still in order from july 1st to july 20. And June is missing. What I want is to go backward in week granularity:
- The last week of July in order
- Second last week of July in order,

### Follow-up 9
Now fix a couple style issue:
- The floating effect of the song-list/calendar tab looks good, but is not consistent with other components.Try make the song panel, avatar and calendar also float like the tab.
- For the calendar, give it a border and background similar to song list to make them consistent. Make the text a lbit clearer to see

### Follow-up 10
Remove the numbers below the date in the calendar

### Follow-up 11
The pop up dialogue does not look great. Let's try make it a drop down expansion panel like SongOccurrence to make the design language consistent. When user clicks the calendar cell, it should expand a panel showing the live recordings of that day, and clicking each recording would expand the timeline just as SongOccurrence, but with multiple layers and is fun to play with. Use consistent and subtle design styles for these drop downs.

Also, the timeline does not look good. Please use the image as a reference. Make the timeline feel modern and intimate and make the song occurrences in a nice bubble. Remember that we might want to extend to other events in the live

### Follow-up 12
Now it's a complete mess:
- Please don't have the arrow, just clicking the cell, expand, click some other cell or click the cell again, collapse.
- Please fix the cell. The texts are all overflow, and clicking had no effect at all.
