## Prompt
OK, I have implemented and deployed a cloudflare worker where the API url can be retrieved from environment with key API_URL`,  (read .env file to understand where it's located) and it exposes the album pic endpoint in `/api/v1/artwork`, which accepts there query parameters:
- title: title of the song
- artist: artist of the song
- size: "small", "medium", or "large"

Please leverage the API to fetch all the album pictures for the songs:
- The API endpoint can be directly used as src in the picture.
- Fetch for large size (640 * 640) and adjust the size to fit the song list
- If API fails, gracefully degrade to using the placeholder icon.

### Follow-up 1
When I test on my phone, I noticed the expansion buttom is a bit misaligned and timestamp is gone. Is it related? I'd like the expansion buttom to always align to right 

### Follow-up 2
Could you add a small bilibili icon which links to the url if a song has one?

### Follow-up 3
On web, the only way to scroll through the search tags is by control + scroll, which is not ideal. Could you add a ghosty > and < button so when user hover to the margin of the grid, it allows the user to scroll through to see other tags?

### Follow-up 4
Please style the button to let it feel like a dew that hovers on the screen naturally

### Follow-up 5
Please fix a bug: when I just enter the page and hover my mouse over the search grid, the buttom did not appear. It only appears after I manually scrolled once.

### Follow-up 6
Noe please fix all the pnpm lint errors

### Follow-up 7
Now please update doc and readme to reflect the new component (serverless API for fetching images). In README instruct the developer to look at @https://github.com/YangchenYe323/firefly-api  for starting a local instance of the API service
