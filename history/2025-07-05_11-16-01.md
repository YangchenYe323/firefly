## Prompt
Now I wanted you to extend the functionality of the admin page. I have added a column `lyrics_fragment` to the Song table, which will store a fragment of lyrics for the given song. In the edit/add song panel, please support editing and adding the lyrics fragment field.

In addition, manually searching up the lyrics is tedious, so I have written an API which will do this. The API can be accessed at ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/v1/song/search. It takes two url query:

- title: the title of the song
- segments: number of lyric segments to return

And it returns a JSON array of the below object
{
  "title": "Song title",
  "artist": "Song artist",
  "album": "Song album",
  "lyrics_fragment": "lyrics fragment",
}

which corresponds to all the search result.

I want you to implement the front end that would allow the user to search for possible matches based on the title field they entered into the panel. Display the search results as cards and allow the user to click one to copy all fields into the panel.

The API takes a couple second so handle loading gracefully.

Please proceed by:

- Read the documentation and the admin page's source code to understand how the page works now.
- Update documentation to reflect the new component and db schema change
- Implement the functionality. Make sure to handle mobile correctly

## Follow-up 1
Before proceeding. The EditableSong component is actually deprecated. Look at the page.tsx in the admin directory to understand what component structure is actually used

## Follow-up 2
Please just use debounce from lodash and yes apply the changes and rerun the linter

## Follow-up 3
Please fix the below bugs:
- The API call failed with admin:1 Access to fetch at 'https://firefly-api.eikasia30.workers.dev/api/v1/song/search?title=%E7%AC%AC57%E6%AC%A1%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%8F%91%E9%80%81&segments=3' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
- Please don't use a separate search input for song title, just use the title field already in the panel.
- Now when I run search, somtimes the song is updated and page refreshed. This is not good. Please fix

## Follow-up 4
Please still send request directly from the frontend. I have a fix to my API server to allow CORS.

## Follow-up 5
Ok I could see the API call succeed, but the result is not displayed at all. Could you fix it? I'd like the results to be shown as cards and the user can click the card, which will copy the title, artist and lyrics fragment to the edit/add panel

## Follow-up 6
Ok so there is a bug to fix. The API actually returns an object with a field songs, which is the array of songs in the specified schema.

## Follow-up 7
Also, could you make the card such that title, artist and lyrics can be separately clicked and copied onto the pane? Sometimes I just want the lyrics

## Follow-up 8
Now also show a truncated lyrisc fragment field in the admin song table. And add a functionality to filter all songs without lyrics
